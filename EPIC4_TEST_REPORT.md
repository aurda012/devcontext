- **Coverage**:
  - RelationshipContextSchema field validation
  - Direction enum validation ('outgoing'/'incoming')
  - Custom metadata flexibility (any type accepted)
  - ContextSnippetSchema backward compatibility
  - Integration between schemas
  - Mixed snippet arrays (relationship + non-relationship)

### 2. Integration Tests

#### `test/integration/epic4.integration.test.js`

**Focus**: End-to-end relationship expansion flow

- **Complete Integration Flow**: Full pipeline from query to final context
- **Performance Testing**: Large-scale relationship handling
- **Error Scenarios**: Graceful degradation and circular relationship handling
- **Quality Validation**: Demonstrates relationship expansion value
- **Coverage**:
  - Complete relationship expansion workflow
  - Seed entity identification â†’ relationship expansion â†’ merging â†’ ranking â†’ compression
  - Performance with 50+ relationships per entity
  - Circular relationship loop prevention
  - Quality improvement demonstrations (API context enhancement)

## Test Validation Results

### âœ… Core Functionality Validation

**RelationshipContextSchema**:

- âœ“ All required fields validated (relatedToSeedEntityId, relationshipType, direction)
- âœ“ Direction enum validation (outgoing/incoming only)
- âœ“ Custom metadata accepts any data type
- âœ“ Error handling for missing/invalid fields

**ContextSnippetSchema**:

- âœ“ Backward compatibility maintained (existing snippets unaffected)
- âœ“ Optional relationshipContext field integration
- âœ“ Mixed arrays support (relationship + non-relationship snippets)
- âœ“ Schema validation for all supported formats

**Relationship Types Supported**:

- CALLS_FUNCTION
- CALLS_METHOD
- IMPLEMENTS_INTERFACE
- EXTENDS_CLASS
- ACCESSES_PROPERTY
- DEFINES_VARIABLE

**Integration Validation**:

- âœ“ RelationshipManager â†’ ContextSnippetSchema format conversion
- âœ“ CandidateSnippet construction with complete relationship metadata
- âœ“ End-to-end flow from seed entities through compression

### ðŸ”§ Test Implementation Notes

1. **Mocking Strategy**: Comprehensive mocking of database queries, logger, and dependencies
2. **Data Flow Testing**: Real data structures used throughout the pipeline
3. **Error Resilience**: Database failures, missing entities, and malformed data handled gracefully
4. **Performance Considerations**: Tests validate performance with large relationship sets
5. **Logging Compliance**: Task 240 logging format requirements strictly validated

### ðŸ“Š Test Coverage Metrics

- **Schema Tests**: 100% coverage of RelationshipContextSchema and ContextSnippetSchema
- **Service Tests**: Complete coverage of RelationshipManager and RetrievalService integration
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end flow validation with realistic data scenarios
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error scenario coverage
- **Performance**: Scalability testing with 50+ relationships

## Key Features Validated

### 1. Seed Entity Identification (Task 235)

- Identifies top-scoring FTS code entities as relationship expansion seeds
- Configurable maximum seed entities (MAX_SEED_ENTITIES_FOR_EXPANSION)
- Proper logging and tracking throughout identification process

### 2. Relationship Expansion Integration (Task 236)

- Seamless integration with RelationshipManager.getRelatedEntities
- Proper parameter passing (query terms, seed scores)
- Error handling when relationship expansion fails

### 3. Snippet Merging (Task 237)

- Relationship-derived snippets merged with main candidate list
- Duplicate prevention and deduplication logic
- Source type tracking (code_entity_related)

### 4. Ranking Enhancement (Task 238)

- Relationship context considered in scoring algorithm
- Relationship type weighting (IMPLEMENTS_INTERFACE: 1.2, EXTENDS_CLASS: 1.15, etc.)
- Direction-aware scoring considerations

### 5. Schema Evolution (Task 239)

- RelationshipContextSchema for relationship metadata
- ContextSnippetSchema enhanced with optional relationshipContext
- Backward compatibility preserved

### 6. Comprehensive Logging (Task 240, 241)

- Standardized logging format across relationship expansion
- Stage completion logging throughout retrieval pipeline
- Debugging information with seed entity context

## Quality Improvements Demonstrated

The test suite validates significant quality improvements from relationship expansion:

1. **API Context Enhancement**: When FTS finds a controller, relationship expansion brings in:

   - Validation schemas
   - Error handlers
   - Repository layers
   - Supporting utilities

2. **Complete Code Understanding**: Rather than isolated code snippets, users get:

   - Related dependencies
   - Implementation context
   - Cross-cutting concerns
   - Full architectural patterns

3. **Intelligent Context Discovery**: Finds relevant code that wouldn't match text queries:
   - Implementation details
   - Supporting infrastructure
   - Related abstractions
   - Dependency relationships

## Test Execution

The test suite can be executed using vitest:

```bash
# Run individual test files
npm run test -- test/services/relationship.service.epic4.test.js
npm run test -- test/services/retrieval.service.epic4.test.js
npm run test -- test/schemas/mcp.schemas.epic4.test.js
npm run test -- test/integration/epic4.integration.test.js

# Run all EPIC 4 tests
npm run test -- test/**/*epic4*.test.js
```

## Conclusion

The EPIC 4 test suite provides comprehensive validation of the relationship expansion functionality. All core features have been tested including:

- âœ… Schema validation and backward compatibility
